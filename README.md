  ## <a id="DESCRIPTION"> DESCRIPTION</a>
  This project is designed to create a web application that can take down a users notes but rather than store them locally use "post" and "get" requests to pass information to a server then have them rendered from that server and also have them be editable.

  ## <a id="INSTALLATION"> INSTALLATION</a>
  "NPM I" or "NPM install" 

  ## <a id="USAGE"> USAGE</a>
  To use the web application a user can enter a title on the notes line and then subsequently enter on the line below the actual note itself. When this happens the user can then see a save button that is now rendered in the top right corner of the screen. Once this is rendered a user can then click on this to have the information they've written saved to the server which can then be seen on the left. the title on the left can now be clicked and it will redisplay the message as a whole once again.
